# Salary Lupin

## About

Brackey Game Jam 에 제출하기 위해서 제작된 프로젝트로, 주제는 "Calm before the storm", 폭풍 전의 고요였습니다. 게임은 월급 루팡(일은 하지 않고 월급을 받는, 훔친다는 의미)에 대한 것으로, 출근 후 카드 게임 및 인터넷 쇼핑 등을 하며 시간을 떼우는 주인공 월급 루팡은 어느 날 착실히 모든 일을 다 하던 직원의 갑작스런 퇴사로 그 직원의 일을 떠맡게 되어 갑자기 바빠지는 상황을 그린 게임입니다. 3분 동안 카드 게임 등을 하며 대충 시간을 떼우다가 (calm) 갑자기 밀려드는 이메일과 서류작업(storm)을 퇴근 전까지 실수 없이 잘 마무리하는 게 게임의 목적입니다. 실수를 하게 되면 생명력을 잃게 되고, 이를 모두 잃으면 해고당합니다. 약 10,000명의 사람들이 이 게임잼에 참여했고, 1,493팀 중 총 338위를 하였으며 innovation 부문에서는 101위를 달성하며 좋은 성적을 거두었습니다.

## Introduction

### "What do I do at work? Um, well I just sit at the desk and playing card game, online shopping till I go home. That's basically it."
Salary Lupin said. 

<br>

Lupin's daily routine is simple. Wake up, go to work, space out, eat lunch, waste time, go home, sleep.  No one really care about him so he can just casually play games at desk and do nothing but, still get paid.

#### What he do for killing time, what he has to do

He didn't have anything to complain. Workload is just zero, no stress, he can just look online shopping website and play card game at work. Cause no one tells him what to do! 

<br>

... But one day, the best worker at his company suddenly quit. Why? Well, there were so so so many workers like Lupin at their company. That person had so much to do on their own and boom.. It happened. Obviously they learnt lots and moved to better company. So his seat is moved to that worker's desk. 

What about works that had been handled by them? Well, guess Lupin will be busy! He has no idea what will happen, I think he's thinking of shopping and game on the way to work.
